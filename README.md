In order to practice JavaScript, we had to individually create a Mastermind. There were some mandatory features which needed to be developped and some bonus features.

### Mandatory features
- The computer has to choose between 5 colors in order to create a random sequence of 4 colors. The same color can be used multiple times
- The player can choose 4 colors out of 5
- The computer should be able to compare its sequence to the player's sequence in order to determine how many colors are well placed and how many colors are misplaced
- The computer should be able to display the result of the comparison to the player
- The computer should be able to display the victory of the winner
- Colors are represented by a letter

### Bonus features
- Colors are represented by color boxes
- The player can only guess 10 times
- Buttons should be displayed to choose colors, validate them or clear them
- Add a button to launch a new game
- Create a game board
- Make the page responsive to play on smartphones
- Darkmode/Lightmode toggle

### Built With

- [HTML 5](https://developer.mozilla.org/fr/docs/Web/HTML) - Layout and web structure
- [CSS 3](https://developer.mozilla.org/fr/docs/Web/CSS) - Style design
- [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/fr/docs/Web/JavaScript) - Web page behavior


## Game Rules

The player has to guess the colors choosen by the computer in the right order.
When colors are well placed, a green number will be displayed.
When a color exists in the computer's sequence but is misplaced, a red number will be displayed.
If the color does not exist, 0 will be displayed.
